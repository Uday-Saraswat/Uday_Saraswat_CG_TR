Today I have learnt about many command in Git and GitHub and also Successfully run all the commands mentioned below.and also i have attached screenshot of my code 

git --version(version detail)
git config --help (help Guide)
git config --global user.username Uday1207 (to add our github profile)
git remote add "remote Key" (add remote key)
git push origin master (push in master)
mkdir cglearning (making new local directory)
cd cglearning (Change Directory)
git init(initializing local git directory)
git add filename (add file to staging area)
git status (check status of eorking tree)
git commit -m'Any Message/information' (commit changes in index)
git push (push in remote server)
git difftool Head
git pull (Pull Latest from remote repository)
git clone (clone Repository into new Directory)
touch <filename> (create empty new file)
git add . (to add all files at same time)

New Branch Create: git checkout <new branch name>
Switch branch: git checkout master
Merge Branch: git merge <new branch name>
commit prompt editor press "i" add commit then press "esc":wq to close editor

Different Stages :-
1.Working Directory
2.Staging area.
3.Repositoy
4.Remote Repository

Create a file and then push it in remote server.
Step 1 Make a new text(any type) file 
Step 2 Add data you want to add in that file 
Step 3 Now we have to check the status using git status 
Step 4 After that we have to run command "git add filename" this will add our file in staging area
Step 5 after that we have to commit message related to that file using thi command " git commit -m"Enter Inormation related to the file".
Step 6 agter commit we have to Push that file in remote server i.e on github. for that we have to use this command "git push".


I have got many error while pushing to remote server 
i.e remote: Permission to Uday1207/Uday_Saraswat-CG.git denied to Uday-Saraswat. fatal: unable to access 'https://github.com/Uday1207/Uday_Saraswat-CG.git/': The requested URL returned error: 403

solution :- i have generate a new SSH key for my computer to read/ edit file of repository using public key of github for my computer 

Cloning	a repository from git hub:-

Step 1 : git clone https://github.com/Uday-Saraswat/Uday_Saraswat_CG_TR.git
Step 2 : you can see repository cloned to our computer 
Step 3 : Now you can update/add/delete files according to your need 
Step 4 : now you have to follow same process git status/git commit/git push to push your updated work in repository
